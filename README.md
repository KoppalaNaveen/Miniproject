## Title of the Project
Square2Sanctuary: An Integrated Platform for AI-Powered House Plan Generation

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Square2Sanctuary : Your personalized House Plan Generator is a comprehensive web application that revolutionizes home planning and digital security through artificial intelligence and advanced cryptography. The platform seamlessly integrates two powerful functionalities: AI-powered house plan generation and military-grade password management. Traditional house planning processes are often complex and require architectural expertise, while password management typically involves insecure practices. This project overcomes these challenges by creating an intuitive interface that generates professional house plans instantly and provides secure password storage with bank-level encryption.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- AI-Powered House Plan Generation: Creates crystal-clear, high-resolution floor plans without closet rooms using mathematical optimization algorithms
- Real-time Room Dimension Calculation: Automatically calculates proportional room sizes based on square footage and BHK requirements
- Secure Password Vault: Implements Fernet encryption (AES-128) with user-specific keys for maximum security
- Password Strength Analyzer: Real-time strength assessment with visual feedback and improvement suggestions
- Multi-layer Authentication: JWT token-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- Responsive Web Interface: Cross-platform compatible design with intuitive navigation
- High-Quality Image Export: Professional 1600x1200 pixel floor plans with color-coded rooms and clear labeling
